# Markdown template

This is a simple Markdown template. The intended use is:
* Browse `.md` files from the file tree on the left.
* Edit the file contents in the editor.
* Click the `Open preview` button in the top right of the editor pane.
* Preview the changes in the preview tab named `Markdown` in the pane to the right.

If you want to view just the editor or preview, simply drag the handle in between the panes and resize.
